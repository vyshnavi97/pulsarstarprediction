# pulsarstarprediction
This project deals with the prediction of pulsar stars using different classifiers like SVM, Random Forests, Logistic Regression etc
Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of considerable scientific interest as probes of space-time, the inter-stellar medium, and states of matter. Generally, pulsar search involves looking for periodic radio signals with large radio telescopes. Each pulsar produces a slightly different emission pattern, which varies slightly with each rotation. Thus, a potential signal detection known as a 'candidate', is averaged over many rotations of the pulsar, as determined by the length of an observation. In the absence of additional info, each candidate could potentially describe a real pulsar. 
There are many pros as Machine learning tools are now being used to automatically label pulsar candidates to facilitate rapid analysis. Hence, we can utilize binary classification to segregate the positive class examples from the spurious examples.
Data Set:
HTRU2 is the name of the data set. This dataset describes a sample of pulsar candidates collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey. It contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. 
Tools and technologies used:
Pandas and NumPy are used to manipulate the dataset.
Support Vector Machines and Clustering classifiers will be used for the data modelling
